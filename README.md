## FEATURES
--------
* Visual Diff Engine: See exact graphical changes in PCB traces, components, and schematics between commits in an exportable and shareable HTML file.
* Manufacturing Ready: Automatically applies JLCPCB's safest design constraints (rules) and generates 1-click production Gerber ZIPs.
* Auto-Documentation: Automatically generates and updates your project's README.md with hardware stats, TODOs, DRC health, and BOM data.
* Workspace Management: Safely stash local changes, switch branches, seamlessly auto-pull safe text files, or execute a clean force-sync of the latest remote version.

* BOM Generation: Choose between Distributor-friendly formats (Qty, Ref, MPN) or detailed Engineering formats.
* Auto-Readme: Toggle the automatic sticky-footer generation that logs your board dimensions, DRC status, and part counts directly to your GitHub repo's README.
* Silent Pull: Enable auto-pulling of text files (like .csv or .md) before pushing to prevent merge conflicts.
* Search Engines: Customize the automated part-search links (e.g., Octopart or ComponentSearchEngine) and currencies used in your Auto-Readme.
